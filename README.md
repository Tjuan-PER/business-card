WHAT I LEARNED

MORE ABOUT FLEXBOX
    Flexbox takes all its direct child and turn it into columns. So, without proper separate
    containers, you might have all your elements lined-up and break the layout.

    Flexbox containers by default ARE display:block;

WHY LEARN INHERITANCE?

UX TIP
///////////////////////////////
Accessibility tip!
    ALTERNATIVE TEXTS ATTRIBUTE
        the alt="message here" attribute gives a description of the image.
        - It makes your site accessible
        - Fallback if the image doesn't render properly
        - Helps your site rank higher on Google as it will look at your alt text too to rank the relvancy of your site.

        HOW TO WRITE ALT TEXT
        - Don't include "image of", the browser already knows it's an image
        - Be concise (<125 characters), SEs tend to cut off extra chars
        - Imagine to describe it to someone "over the phone".
